# Echelon
Currently there is no way of accessing functions through console without modifying ```main.c```.
If you wish to do so, all the function names and parameters can be found in ```matrix.h```.
To execute Echelon, enter the following in terminal or similar:
```
gcc -o echelon main.c matrix.c
```
```
./echelon
```
